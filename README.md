Implemented functionality:
- ohm's law
- resistive divider

The key feature is the ability to perform calculations taking into account the tolerance of each entered value.

Planned functionality:
- in a resistive divider, selection of the closest resistances from a series of nominal resistances and comparison of results
- in a resistive divider, accounting for or calculation of the load in each arm
- add calculation of losses in all types of transistors and comparison of results for selection of the optimal transistor for the task
- add a multilingual interface
- add calculation of chokes and transformers
- add calculation of pulse power supplies
- add calculation of tracks and vias on printed circuit boards
